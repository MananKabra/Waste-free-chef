## Introduction

Welcome to the README file for WFC (Waste Free Chef)! This app is designed to reduce food waste and provide food to the needy. Our target audience is anyone who wants to help reduce food waste and contribute to a good cause.

## Design System

The design system for this app is built on Flutter. We have used Material Design guidelines for our UI components, and our app is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Technologies Used

We have used the following technologies to build this app:

- Flutter for UI development
- Firebase for database management and authentication
- Our own API for custom data management
- Dialogflow for query bot integration
- Mapbox API for location-based services

## Database Management

We have used Firebase to manage and store data for the app and helps the food providers to manage the orders data. This enables us to provide a more tailored experience for our users.

## Query Bot

We have integrated Dialogflow into our app to create a query bot. The bot allows users to ask questions and get instant answers. We have used natural language processing (NLP) to enable the bot to understand user queries and respond accordingly.

## Map Integration

We have used the Mapbox API to enable location-based services in the app. This allows users to view available food donations on a map and get directions to the donation location. We have used custom markers to make it easy for users to identify donation locations.


## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to install Flutter on your system. Once you have installed Flutter, you can clone the project from our GitHub repository and run it on your device. You will also need to set up Firebase and Dialogflow accounts to use the app.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in our app! We hope that our app will help reduce food waste and provide food to those in need. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us.
